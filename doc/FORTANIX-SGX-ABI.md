## Changelog

### Version 0.4.0

* Added support for new rust-lang toolchain which fixes: https://github.com/fortanix/rust-sgx/issues/174

### Version 0.3.2

* *No semantic changes.*
* More changes to allow building as a crates.io dependency of `std`.

### Version 0.3.1

* *No semantic changes.*
* Changes to allow building as a crates.io dependency of `std`.

### Version 0.3.0

* Return values are now two registers wide instead of one.
* No longer distinguish between “panic exit” and “usercall exit”. Panic
  signalling is now done at the API level.
* Renamed “libenclave ABI” to “Fortanix SGX ABI”.
* TLS size and contents updated.

### Version 0.2.3

* TLS size and contents updated.

### Version 0.2.2

* TLS size updated. Debug TLS size is now the same as non-debug size.

### Version 0.2.1

* AEX debug handler removed.

### Version 0.2.0

* Usercall register saving semantics changed. The enclave no longer
  distinguishes between normal enters and usercall enters for purposes of
  saving user register state.

### Version 0.1.3

* TLS size and contents updated.

## Thread settings

This section describes the requirements on the SGX thread control structure 
(TCS), thread local storage (TLS) and thread stacks.

### TCS

- `NSSA` should be set to 1.
- `OGSBASGX` should point to a thread-specific memory region (e.g. TLS) of at 
  least 112 bytes.

### TLS

The memory region pointed to by `OGSBASGX` should be initialized as follows:

- Offset `0x0`: Top-of-Stack offset from image base.
- Offset `0x8`: `1` if this is an executable and this is a secondary TCS, `0`
  otherwise.
- Offsets `0x10`, `0x18`, `0x20`: `0`
- Other offsets: uninitialized.

## Globals

This section describes the requirements for various global constants in the SGX
binary.

- `HEAP_BASE`. Size 8 bytes. The base address (relative to enclave start) of
  the heap area, little-endian.
- `HEAP_SIZE`. Size 8 bytes. The heap size in bytes, little-endian.
- `ENCLAVE_SIZE`. Size 8 bytes. The enclave size in bytes, little-endian.
- `CFGDATA_BASE`. Size 8 bytes. The base address (relative to enclave start) of
  the enclave configuration area, little-endian.
- `RELA`. Size 8 bytes. Value of the RELA entry in the dynamic table.
- `RELACOUNT`. Size 8 bytes. Value of the RELACOUNT entry in the dynamic table.
- `DEBUG`. Size 1 byte. Non-zero if debugging is enabled, zero otherwise.

## Enclave calling convention

Upon `EENTER`, besides the standard SGX control registers, parameters are 
passed in:

- RDI
- RSI
- RDX
- R8
- R9

Upon `EEXIT`, a value is returned in:

- RDI
- RSI
- RDX

See below for the meaning of the values in these registers.

The following registers should be saved by the caller:

- ENCLU registers (RAX, RBX, RCX)
- R10
- R11

The following registers will be saved by the callee (enclave):

- RSP
- RBP
- R12
- R13
- R14
- R15

Flags are affected as follows:

- CF, PF, AF, ZF, SF, OF, DF are cleared

### Exit value

Upon `EEXIT`, RDI will have one of the following values:

- `0`: Normal exit, any possible return value is in RDX:RSI. The TCS may be
  entered again later.
- Other: A “user call” is requested by the enclave. See below for register 
  usage. After servicing the user call request, execute EENTER again for the 
  same TCS. A normal exit following a usercall entry will return to the new
  entry point from where the usercall was returned.

### User call calling convention
  
Upon `EEXIT`, parameters are passed in:

- RDI
- RSI
- RDX
- R8
- R9

As discussed above under “exit value”, only non-zero values can be
passed in RDI. In addition, RDI values have special meaning as discussed below
under “Usercalls”.

Upon `EENTER`, a value is returned in:

- RSI
- RDX

The following registers will be saved by the caller (enclave):

- all registers (callee can use any register)

The following registers will be restored to the state they were in when the
enclave was last entered:

- RSP
- RBP
- R12
- R13
- R14
- R15

## Debug mode

This section describes the differences with the stated above when the enclave 
is compiled in debug mode.

### Enclave calling convention

Upon `EENTER`, a special parameter is passed in:

- R10

R10 should contain a pointer to a 1024-byte buffer in writable user memory. The 
enclave can write debugging messages to this buffer upon panic exit. The memory
location is only valid until the enclave performs `EEXIT`.
